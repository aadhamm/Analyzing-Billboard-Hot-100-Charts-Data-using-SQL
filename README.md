# Analyzing-Billboard-Hot-100-Charts-Data-using-SQL (1965 - 2021)
This project aims to analyze the Billboard Hot 100 Charts data using SQL and Microsoft SQL Server. The dataset includes information on the songs that made it to the charts, their performers, their peak positions, and the number of weeks they spent on the chart.

## Technologies Used
- Microsoft SQL Server
- SQL

## Requirements
- Microsoft SQL Server installed on your machine
- The Billboard Hot 100 Charts data in a SQL database format

## Usage
1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
3. Create a new database in SQL Server.
4. Import the Billboard Hot 100 Charts data into the database.
5. Open the SQL scripts provided in the repository using SQL Server Management Studio.
6. Run the SQL scripts to perform the desired analyses.

## SQL Queries
The following SQL queries are included in this project:
- Find the number of unique songs and unique performers in the dataset
- Find the top 10 songs with the highest peak position
- Find the number of weeks each song has been on the chart
- Find the number of songs that have dropped from a certain position to a lower position on the chart

## Results
The SQL queries provide insights into the popularity and longevity of songs on the Billboard Hot 100 Charts. By analyzing the number of unique songs and performers, we can see the diversity of music represented on the charts. By identifying the top 10 songs with the highest peak position, we can see which songs were most popular at their peak. By analyzing the number of weeks each song spent on the chart, we can see which songs had the most staying power. Finally, by identifying the number of songs that dropped from a certain position to a lower position on the chart, we can see which songs had the biggest drops in popularity.

## Conclusion
Using SQL and Microsoft SQL Server, we can gain insights into the Billboard Hot 100 Charts data that can inform business decisions for music streaming services such as Spotify. By understanding which songs are most popular and which have the most staying power, we can curate playlists and make recommendations to users that reflect their musical interests and preferences.
